## Project Description

We are going Digitransit's vehicle position [High-frequency positioning (HFP)](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/) API to fetch specific buses that passes by the campus premises. The app will show real time tracking of all the busses going or coming to the range of the area.

Details about how to present the data will be refined when we go along the project demo.
