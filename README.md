## Project Description

We are going Digitransit's vehicle position [High-frequency positioning (HFP)](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/) API to fetch specific buses that passes by the campus premises. The app will show real time tracking of all the buses going or coming to the range of the area.

Details about how to present the data will be refined when we go along the project demo.

## About WebScoket

WebSocket provides applications a way of communicating with the server that does not require opening multiple HTTP connections. WebSocket is a naturally full-duplex,
bidirectional, single-socket connection, so there is no need to continuously poll the server for updates and the server has one connection for each client.

WebSocket is useful for applications that require efficient real time communication, like games, multiuser applications with simultaneous
editing, chat, video conferencing, social media feeds, stock tickers, real time tracking of position and timetables.
